Line Follower Bot - White Line on Black Surface

This repository contains the code and instructions for building a line follower bot that autonomously navigates by following a white line on a black surface. This is a classic robotics project that introduces concepts like sensor interfacing, motor control, and basic programming.

Hardware Requirements:

Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano, etc.)
DC Motors (2 geared motors with appropriate drivers)
IR Sensor Modules (5 or 7, depending on complexity)
Wheels (2 driven wheels and 2 caster wheels for stability)
Breadboard and Jumper Wires
Power Source (Batteries or power supply)
Black surface material (e.g., construction paper, cardboard)
White tape or paint

Software Requirements :
Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

Calibration

Sensor Calibration: Place the bot on a black surface with the white line centered between the sensors. Adjust the sensor positions or code thresholds (if applicable) to ensure both sensors read similar values when directly over the line.

Line Following Test: Run the code and observe the bot's behavior. Fine-tune the code parameters (motor speeds, thresholds) to achieve smooth and accurate line following.
